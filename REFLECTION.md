## What did you learn about using Git and GitHub?
I leaned that Git is a great and easy way to track and push changes to source code and GitHub is the place that hosts it.

## What was most confusing or frustrating?
The most confusing part was wrapping my brain around what commits do exactly and why there are three commands you have to do to push changes to your code on GitHub.

## Why do you think developers use Git?
I think developers use Git because it journals changes and allows for things to be rolled back in case of mistakes or disasters.

## How might this help with larger projects in the future?
I think this might help with larger projects in the future because you can roll back code to a point prior to a change occurring and implement versioning on your source code.
